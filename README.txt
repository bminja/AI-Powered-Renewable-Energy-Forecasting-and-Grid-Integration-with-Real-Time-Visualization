# 1.125: Architecting and Engineering Software Systems - Fall 2024

## INTRODUCTION
This is the project for 1.125: Architecting and Engineering Software Systems Fall 2024.  
The goal of the project is to create an energy forecasting app that is trained on historical
weather data and recorded energy production values. Given weather forecasts, the app predicts 
energy generation for corresponding times.



## FOLDERS
- `data_collection/`: Contains historical weather data and energy production records.
- `Past Implementations/`: Contains past attempts that have been unsuccessful .
- `Machine_Learning_model/`: Contains an example method of implementing a machine learning model.
- `progress_tracking/`: Ideally this folder would keep track of where we get our data from and next steps.
